# 🌊 Salinity Prediction using Stacking Regressor & ANN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **salinity levels** using a combination of **Stacking Regressor and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. The model is trained on environmental and oceanographic data to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging multiple regression techniques.  

### ✅ **Objectives**  
- Develop a predictive model for **salinity concentration**.  
- Use **Stacking Regressor** to combine multiple regression models for better performance.  
- Implement an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for deep learning-based prediction.  
- Compare traditional machine learning models with ANN.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **oceanographic readings**, including variables such as:  
- **Temperature (°C)**  
- **pH Levels**  
- **Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)**  
- **Salinity (g/kg)** (Target Variable)  
- **Other environmental factors**  

📌 **Data Preprocessing Steps:**  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature scaling & normalization  
- Splitting into training & testing sets
